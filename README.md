# Brasil Cities Covid Deaths Choropleth Map

## Description

This project was a proof of concept made to sell the idea of building this visual story [g1 project](https://especiais.g1.globo.com/bemestar/coronavirus/2021/mapa-cidades-brasil-mortes-covid/).

Using VueJS with Leaflet the map works by fetching data directly from [Wesley Cota COVID-19 Brazil repository](https://github.com/wcota/covid19br), to filter and render the choropleth map.

Besides the map this project is a test for using basic Domain Driven Design patterns in front-ent projects.
